#' Assessing consistency using node-splitting model
#'
#' This function is used to make node-splitting inconsistency model. The structure is similar to the function \code{\link{network.data}}
#'
#' @param Outcomes Arm-level outcomes. If it is a multinomial response, the matrix would be arms (row) by multinomial categories (column). If it is binomial or normal, it would be a vector.
#' @param Study A vector of study indicator for each arm
#' @param Treat A vector of treatment indicator for each arm. Treatments should have positive integer values starting from 1 to total number of treatments. In a study, lowest number is taken as the baseline treatment.
#' @param N A vector of total number of observations in each arm. Used for binomial and multinomial responses.
#' @param SE A vector of standard error for each arm. Used only for normal response.
#' @param response Specification of the outcomes type. Must specify one of the following: "normal", "binomial", or "multinomial".
#' @param type Type of model fitted: either "random" for random effects model or "fixed" for fixed effects model. Default is "random".
